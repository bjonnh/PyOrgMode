   Added a Clock plugin in order to manage CLOCK: elements
      Thank to "siberianlaika" for the idea
   Added a TYPE attribute to the different OrgPlugins elements
      Maybe we should find a more practical way than this one
   Removed some debug "prints"
   Indentation problem that causes wrong reparenting
      Thanks to Matthew Robison for his patch
   Added a append_clean function to Node class
      This function is used to add a tree to a node
      A call to reparent_cleanlevels is done at the end
   Added reparent_cleanlevels to Node class
      This function reparent all the elements. Using a 
      content to parent way of doing. It checks the content
      of the first element (call it E), and set the parent of
      each E-childs to E. This is really useful when moving
      one tree to another place.
   Loading the default plugins in the Node class init.
      This avoids to do it in the load_from_file (which was a 
      bad idea).
   Added a new example 
      using the TYPE attribute and append_clean.
